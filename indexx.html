            <div class="cc"><h2>Who is Reed Hastings?</h2><br>
                Reed Hastings is an American entrepreneur from Boston, Massachusetts. While he has been involved in several businesses, his most famous contribution is co-founding Netflix and leading the media-streaming company as CEO since 1998, He’s well-known for his unique leadership style and success in entrepreneurism. Explore the early life, career, and achievements of this self-made billionaire and American media mogul. <br>
                <div class="ee">Founding of Pure Software</div>
Hastings' first job was at Adaptive Technology, where he created a tool for debugging software. He met Audrey MacLean in 1990 when she was CEO at Adaptive Corp. In 2007, Hastings told CNN, "From her, I learned the value of focus. I learned it is better to do one product well than two products in a mediocre way."

Hastings left Adaptive Technology in 1991 to lay the foundation to his first company, Pure Software, which produced products to troubleshoot software. The company's growth proved challenging for Hastings, as he lacked managerial experience. He stated he had trouble managing with a rapid headcount growth.[1] His engineering background didn't prepare him for the challenges of being a CEO, and he asked his board to replace him, stating he was losing confidence.[11] The board refused, and Hastings says he learned to be a businessman.[6] Pure Software was taken public by Morgan Stanley in 1995.[6]

In 1996, Pure Software announced a merger with Atria Software. The merger integrated Pure Software's programs for detecting bugs in software with Atria's tools to manage development of complex software.[12] The Wall Street Journal reported that there were problems integrating the sales forces of Pure Software and Atria after the head salesmen for both Pure and Atria left following the merger.[13]

In 1997, the combined company, Pure Atria, was acquired by Rational Software, which triggered a 42% drop in both companies' stocks after the deal was announced.[13] Hastings was appointed Chief Technical Officer of the combined companies and left soon after the acquisition.[14] After Pure Software, Hastings spent two years thinking about how to avoid similar problems at his next startup.
